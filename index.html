            <p>
              I chose to redesign the <a href="https://www.eastsidepocket.com/">East Side Pockets Website</a> because of
              the immediate contrast and organization errors that jumped out to me. After a more thorough analysis of
              the site, I came up with the following problems + fixes:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Navigation Simplification:</b> Streamline the navigation by reducing the number of headers, which will
              mitigate confusion and help users prioritize where to click. Organize content under broad categories for
              easier access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Hierarchy and Typography:</b> Establish a clear visual hierarchy by using headers and body text
              more appropriately. Ensure that headings stand out and guide the visitor through the site, and that body
              text is easily readable for detailed information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Contrast and Readability:</b> Improve readability by increasing the contrast between text and
              background images. Add text shadows or placing text on semi-transparent overlays where it overlaps with
              images to ensure the words are legible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Content Presentation:</b> Make the welcome message and introduction to East Side Pockets more
              prominent. It should be immediately visible and distinguishable from other elements to effectively
              communicate the site’s purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Image Layout:</b> Address the clutter of images by spacing them out and strategically placing them to
              complement the text and other site content. Each image should be distinct to avoid visual confusion and to
              allow each menu item to shine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Color Palette:</b> Choose a color palette that complements the food and creates a warm, inviting
              atmosphere. The color scheme should be consistent throughout the site, reinforcing the brand and enhancing
              the aesthetic appeal.
            </li>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Waive Analysis</h3>

          <div class="body">
            <div class="images-container waive-images">
              <img src="images/waive/analysis.png" alt="Waive Analysis" />
              <div class="small-container">
                <img src="images/waive/alerts.png" alt="Waive Alerts" />
                <img src="images/waive/contrast.png" alt="Waive Contrast" />
              </div>
            </div>
            There weren’t many errors from the WAVE analysis besides a singular contrast error and a few alerts. I agree
            with the contrast error; in general, the color scheme of the site should be fixed to match better and have
            better contrast. The alerts seem mainly to concern the alternative text on the images, which is an easily
            fixable coding issue.

          <div class="body">
            <p>
              I began the visual redesign process by sketching out 9 different frames of potential ideas, giving 1
              minute to each frame. Then, I created a final sketch that drew components from each idea.

              Then, I came up with the low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs based off my initial sketches and the

              mobile.

            <p>
              I used HTML/CSS + JS in order to create the website page. I started by initially plotting out the overall
              layout of the page, then later polished the more granular details. One notable challenge I ran into was
              the resizing of the screens. To fix this, I had to play around with custom font-weights and image sizes /
              layouts at each different width breakpoint.

            <h3>A few thoughts...</h3>
            <li>
                When I initially redesigned this website, I was a little overwhelmed because my mindset was to 
                redesign the entire site from scratch. However, I've learned that that's unecessary and that designers
                will often imitate components from their favorite websites. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Even with the above in mind, it was still difficult to figure out the style of the site--specifically its layout 
                and color. My personal favorite websites are clean, sleek, tech blog type websites, so that's where I initially drew
                inspiration from. However, I quickly realized that that didn't fit in with the message that East Side Pockets 
                was trying to generate (more of a ~home-y and earth-y feel). 
            </li>
            <li>
                I actually haven't created a pure HTML/CSS website before this (only React), and it surprised me
                how simple but powerful the basics are. Perhaps I'll make more of these type of lightweight sites.
            </li>

            Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to experience the full cycle of designing, iterating,
            and prototyping a legitimate website. I'm really glad I took on this project and I'm excited for future design works!
