          <h3>Website Critique</h3>

          <div class="body">

                <img src="images/original-east.png" alt="Original East Side Pockets Website" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This was the original website that I chose. After conducting analysis of the site, I came up with the
              following fixes:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Navigation Simplification:</b> Streamline the navigation by reducing the number of headers, which will
              mitigate confusion and help users prioritize where to click. Organize content under broad categories for
              easier access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Hierarchy and Typography:</b> Establish a clear visual hierarchy by using headers and body text
              more appropriately. Ensure that headings stand out and guide the visitor through the site, and that body
              text is easily readable for detailed information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Contrast and Readability:</b> Improve readability by increasing the contrast between text and
              background images. Add text shadows or placing text on semi-transparent overlays where it overlaps with
              images to ensure the words are legible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Content Presentation:</b> Make the welcome message and introduction to East Side Pockets more
              prominent. It should be immediately visible and distinguishable from other elements to effectively
              communicate the site’s purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Image Layout:</b> Address the clutter of images by spacing them out and strategically placing them to
              complement the text and other site content. Each image should be distinct to avoid visual confusion and to
              allow each menu item to shine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Color Palette:</b> Choose a color palette that complements the food and creates a warm, inviting
              atmosphere. The color scheme should be consistent throughout the site, reinforcing the brand and enhancing
              the aesthetic appeal.
            </li>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Waive Analysis</h3>

          <div class="body">
            <div class="images-container waive-images">
              <img src="images/waive/analysis.png" alt="Waive Analysis" />
              <div class="small-container">
                <img src="images/waive/alerts.png" alt="Waive Alerts" />
                <img src="images/waive/contrast.png" alt="Waive Contrast" />
              </div>
            </div>
            There weren’t many errors from the WAVE analysis besides a singular contrast error and a few alerts. I agree
            with the contrast error; in general, the color scheme of the site should be fixed to match better and have
            better contrast. The alerts seem mainly to concern the alternative text on the images, which is an easily
            fixable coding issue.

            <p>
                I began the visual redesign process by sketching out 9 different frames of potential ideas, giving 
                1 minute to each frame.

                Then, I came up with the low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs based off my initial sketches

            <p>
              I used HTML/CSS + JS in order to create the website page. I started by initially plotting out the overall
              layout of the page, then later polished the more granular details. As I was coding it up, there were some
              challenges in resizing that I fixed by employing media breakpoint queries.
